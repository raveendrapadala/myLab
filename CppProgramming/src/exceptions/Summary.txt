Guidelines while passing Objects to handlers.
---------------------------------------------
1. Exception Objects can be passed to handlers either by value or by reference. 
2. The memory for the exception that is being thrown is allocated in an unspecified way (but it is not allocated on the free store). 
3. Some implementations use a dedicated exception stack, on which exception objects are created. 
4. When an exception is passed by reference, the handler receives a reference to the exception object that is constructed on the exception stack. 
5. Passing an exception by reference ensures its polymorphic behavior. 
6. Repeatedly copying objects that are passed by value is costly because the exception object can be constructed and destroyed several times before a matching handler has been found.
7. Any exception can be caught using ellipses in the argument list.
		eg: catch (â€¦)
